              <p class="para">1. First problem was the Navigation. The navigation bar was on the bottom of the website’s name and the website logo(see the screenshot of website).

              <p class="para mt-3">2. Second problem the users were facing(the most painful one) was the steps it took the students(the users)to get their exam results. In the current website it takes 2–3 steps to get the exam results.</p>

          <p class="para">So after talking to one of my college friend(One of the users of the website) about the current website’s user interface and what can be improved in the website’s layout. I came up with these wireframes. While talking to my friend about the website, one thing that I’ve learned that: The website has so much visual noise and repetitive information’s. So while working on wireframes I had this my mind that the website’s UI has to be neat and clean.</p>

Like how I am gonna divide notifications and news sections that are really important for us students ?? The results page was the page that I think challenged me the most. I wanted the user(student) to get his/her result as quick as possible. I wanted the result form options to be as specific as possible. So after 2–3 iterations I Finally came up with the final prototype and the final UI screens. For the prototyping and designing the UI, I’ve used figma.</p>
